MC68030 Based SBC 

Simple SBC to learn from.  This board will have the minimal required for a simple computer, 8M SRAM, 8M FLASH, 1M Boot ROM, plus a MPCC for serial, and a PIT For OS timer and generic parallel IO. Hopefully I will be able to port linux to it after I add A DRAM board to the design.

There will be at least one "Expansion" header, I plan on using a 3x150 DIN for this since it will need the entire bus and lots of power and ground lines.  Since I am using a standard connector it means I can also use the pin jumpers I have for my breadboard here as well.

Lots of inspo from:

I used some of the symbols and footprints from ddraig.


This project is very much a work in progress, and may never be finished...
